const CHANGELOG = [
  { v: '1.46', notes: 'Massive content expansion: 50 worlds total (W12–W50 procedural sectors), intro/outro cutscenes for every world, special Challenger cutscenes, 4 new swarm enemy sprites, one world-exclusive skill per world from W8 onward, 12 milestone characters and 12 milestone pets, and HP/damage scaling that continues past World 10.' },
  { v: '1.45', notes: 'Rebranded to Brainrot Swarm — new title, subtitles, and Android package id (gg.brainrot.swarm). Removed Italian Invasion branding.' },
  { v: '1.44', notes: 'Mobile graphics fix: sharper canvas resolution on phones (old low-quality default made everything look soft/blurry). Settings → Quality now goes up to Ultra. Existing saves auto-upgrade on next load.' },
  { v: '1.43', notes: 'Removed Supabase — the game is now packaged for Google Play (Capacitor Android) with Google Play Games cloud saves. Web play is guest/local only. Added Android publishing guide in docs/ANDROID_PUBLISH.md.' },
  { v: '1.42', notes: 'Update Log popup is wider on PC and now properly scrolls on mobile instead of getting cut off.' },
  { v: '1.41', notes: 'Pet Recruit now plays a drumroll build-up during the gacha cutscene and a reveal chime when the card flips. Il Professore moved from the Character Shop to a World 9 unlock. Engineer is now in the Character Shop for 15 gems.' },
  { v: '1.40', notes: 'All turrets (Walking, Minigun, Flamethrower, Engineer placed) now also target and damage lucky blocks, not just enemies.' },
  { v: '1.39', notes: 'Fixed EVOLVE card screens showing one unfilled star — they now show all stars filled since picking EVOLVE maxes the card out.' },
  { v: '1.38', notes: 'Fixed Walking Turret card not adding a turret on top of Engineer\'s starting 2. Dashing as Engineer at the 3-turret cap now destroys the oldest placed turret and places a new one instead of doing nothing.' },
  { v: '1.37', notes: 'Engineer is now unlocked at World 2 (for now), instead of being a gem-shop character.' },
  { v: '1.36', notes: 'New character: Engineer! Fires no bullets of his own — starts with 2 turrets that share all his stats, and Dash is replaced with placing a stationary turret (25 HP, max 3). Two new Engineer-exclusive cards: Minigun Turret (fast, low damage, +fire rate then +1 turret) and Flamethrower Turret (AOE flame damage).' },
  { v: '1.26', notes: 'Fixed ability cards showing extra unreachable stars after evolving (e.g. Turret Network showed 5 star slots for a card with only 4 real levels).' },
  { v: '1.25', notes: 'Added a one-time cutscene after first clearing World 1: Ting Ting Ting Bahur rises from defeat and revives his fallen army before they vow to grow stronger.' },
  { v: '1.15', notes: 'Walking Turret redesigned: detailed tripod body with a swiveling twin-barrel head instead of a flat top-down disc. Its card description is shorter too.' },
  { v: '1.14', notes: 'Fantasma is now a Legendary character shop-only — no longer a World 9 unlock. La Strega has been removed from the game.' },
  { v: '1.13', notes: 'Challenger mode buffed: bigger boss arenas (even bigger on phase 3 finales), enemies hit harder and scale with world, 30% more mobs early on, mobs spawn closer in on wide screens, and Challenger now has its own danger-badge world icon.' },
  { v: '1.12', notes: 'Fixed world-select arrow buttons shifting position depending on world name length (title box is now a fixed width, not just a minimum).' },
  { v: '1.11', notes: 'Fixed UI layout jitter: world title, shop character carousel, weekly legendary card, and character-select button no longer shift position when text length changes.' },
  { v: '1.10', notes: 'Pulse Wave (shockwave): radius buffed to actually match its visual size, but damage nerfed and now scales off radius too, not just a flat number.' },
  { v: '1.09', notes: 'Ability cards now show up more often in level-up draws while you have none yet.' },
  { v: '1.08', notes: 'Walking Turret card is now Epic rarity.' },
  { v: '1.07', notes: 'Walking Turret card now available from World 1. Pets and characters got small idle animations (sways, glints, flickers) to feel more alive.' },
  { v: '1.06', notes: 'Added the Walking Turret card: a turret that trails behind your pet and auto-fires the closest enemy.' },
  { v: '1.05', notes: 'Fortunato now starts with 2 projectiles and can no longer pick Splinter Shot.' },
  { v: '1.04', notes: 'Added in-game Update Log (Settings → Update Log).' },
  { v: '1.03', notes: 'Added a Death Shake toggle in Settings; Calamita pet now pulses its magnet every 60s in Challenger mode.' },
  { v: '1.02', notes: 'Fixed some Inventory items becoming unselectable after a cloud-account restore (gear uid collision).' },
  { v: '1.01', notes: 'Removed the daily free coins shop feature.' },
